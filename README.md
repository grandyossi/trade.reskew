# trade.reskew

An AngularJS 1.8 SPA (via node.js & mongoDB), which serves as a derivatives-pricing instrument.
 
This application's logic is based on many years of personal trading & analysis experience.
I've never installed / tested any derivatives-pricing application of any kind -
So any similarity to an existing application / software is sheer incidental.
 
Please be careful.
I encourage you NEVER to participate in stock exchange TRADING of ANY kind.
Just don't!
Avoid it!
Just let the trading robots annihilate each other.
