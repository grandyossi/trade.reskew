# trade.reskew
 
An AngularJS 1.6 SPA (via node.js & mongoDB), which serves as a derivatives-pricing instrument.

1. General <br/>
This application's logic is based on many years of personal trading & analysis experience. <br/>
I've never installed / tested any derivatives-pricing application of any kind -<br/>
So any similarity to an existing application / software is a sheer incidental outcome.

2. Structure <br/> 
"view" - Contains all the files which are HTTP transmitted to the end-user. <br/>
"server" - The node.js server app (notice "Server.RC.js" lines 101-102). <br/>
"server/db" - mongoimport these files to the DB.

3. Please <br/>
I encourage you to NEVER participate in stock exchange TRADING of ANY kind. <br/>
Just don't! <br/>
Avoid it! <br/>
Let the trading robots annihilate each other.<br/>
 
 
Check out the video file - to see how iâ€™ve tested the latest version.
