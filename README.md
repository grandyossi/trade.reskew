# trade.reskew
 
An AngularJS 1.8 SPA (via node.js & mongoDB), which serves as a derivatives-pricing instrument.
 
1. General
This application's logic is based on many years of personal trading & analysis experience.
I've never installed / tested any derivatives-pricing application of any kind -
So any similarity to an existing application / software is a sheer incidental outcome.
 
2. Structure
"view" - Contains all the files which are HTTP transmitted to the end-user.
"server" - The node.js server app (notice "Server.RC.js" lines 101-102).
"server/db" - Files to mongoimport to the DB.
 
3. Please
I encourage you NEVER to participate in stock exchange TRADING of ANY kind.
Just don't!
Avoid it!
Let the trading robots annihilate each other.
 
 
Check out the video file - to see how iâ€™ve tested the latest version.
